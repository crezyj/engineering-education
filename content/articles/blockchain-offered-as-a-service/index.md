Blockchain as a Service.
### Introduction

Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) is the establishment and management of cloud-based networks by a third party for companies that develop blockchain applications. BaaS is based on the software as a service (SaaS) model and allows clients to use cloud services to build, host services, work on apps, and other blockchain-related functions. Clients benefit from BaaS because it allows for faster application development, lower maintenance costs, and faster adoption of Blockchain technology.
### Prerequisites
To understand this article one should have:
1. Good knowledge and understanding of how blockchain works.
2. Good understanding of the basics of Blockchain.
3. Basic information about applications of Blockchain.

### Understanding  BaaS.
In a world of distributed applications, blockchain can provide to any type of application, including those centralized ones we’re all used to. Nowadays there are many types of blockchains each with its own characteristics which make them more or less suitable for use by large enterprises and small businesses alike. As such, cloud providers should embrace the technology and offer blockchain as a service to their customers.

Today, the technology behind blockchains is still rather complicated for most people to use regularly. For example, setting up a validator node for some public networks such as Ethereum can be a tedious process requiring some Linux knowledge. A large amount of time and effort must be spent to ensure the blockchain software has been configured correctly and is running smoothly without any unforeseen issues. If something goes wrong, one must troubleshoot the issue or look to the documentation for guidance.

The same applies to some other public blockchains such as Bitcoin where full nodes require a server farm to verify transactions since it’s not possible for a single desktop machine to do the job. For enterprises, running a full node for each blockchain they want to use is often not feasible due to financial and resource constraints especially during the early phases of adoption. As such, it would be best if cloud providers started offering blockchain as a service where customers can quickly get up and running with their own nodes or a preconfigured virtual machine.
### Reasons Companies choose BaaS?
  1. Businesses that use Blockchain as a Service acquire access to qualified Blockchain developers, procedure and management specialists, the whole infrastructure from cloud service provider for developing, programming, and deploying, not worrying about budget costs for any other operation that would cost them more.
		
  2. In most situations, a reputable BaaS partner is a source of practical expertise and knowledge that can improve the security of the systems. It considerably reduces the dangerous cases that might otherwise be encountered if it were created in-house

### Example of application
A good example of a cloud provider that offers blockchain as a service is Microsoft Azure, with options to use both Ethereum and BitCoin’s blockchains. The service costs about $13 per month for the most basic of configurations which is rather steep compared to some other VPS providers such as DigitalOcean who charge $5.

In addition to setting up a node, blockchain as a service provider should also offer tools for the easy deployment of smart contracts so that customers and even third parties can create and deploy software in a decentralized way. It is also encouraged that these providers design their systems with an open API for easy integration into existing applications.

One of the most promising blockchain as a service provider is IBM’s Bluemix which offers both Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum blockchains or an alternative with their own Corda blockchain. This platform also provides all the tooling needed to develop smart contracts in many different languages. Although still in beta, this service looks promising and could be a serious contender to Azure if they continue to market the platform as successfully as they have been doing.

It isn’t yet clear how blockchain as a service can be used by traditional enterprises but this shouldn’t stop these providers from offering their platforms since it will benefit them in the long run. Customers who are interested in using blockchain to improve their business models will flock to service providers offering this technology.

As time goes by, the market for these services may grow enough to warrant the design of a decentralized cloud computing marketplace where anyone can use their idle resources to earn income. The future is now and now is the future.

### Considerations When Choosing a Blockchain as a Service Provider 
Choosing a business vendor necessitates a great deal of thought and analysis, and in the case of BaaS, this will be even more challenging due to the lack of readily available standards and best practices in the market. While there are numerous things to consider when selecting a BaaS provider, there are a few general rules to follow.

1. Prior experience/credentials in establishing blockchain infrastructure.
Make sure your BaaS provider has a track record of creating and Blockchain technology deployment and in a similar environment to the one you propose. If at all possible, inquire about qualifications or references from former clients.
		

2. Commitment to Quality.
Any enterprise application or software installation effort must prioritize quality. Blockchain is no exception. Inquire about the dedication to quality, process, and standards of the vendor.
		

3. Affirmation of safety.
Look for any security flaws in the proposed implementation strategy. It's critical because even minor flaws can have serious consequences. When it comes to distributed ledgers, it is critical to plan for the most dependable results.
4. Operation System Selection.
Examine the previous installations of cloud-based services and the system they operate on that are similar to yours by the vendor. You must also guarantee that the new Blockchain installation works in tandem with your existing system.
 5. Usability.
Ensure Blockchain-enabled systems and processes you're proposing are simple to use and implement. After all, you don't want a system that's difficult to use or navigate for your staff, since this could lower adoption rates and hurt your bottom line.
 6. Prices and Supporters.
Every customer desires to pay Cost of that which a BaaS provider provides. Examine alternatives of pricing as well as the deploying support and modalities carefully. Paying for that which adds biggest value to your company.
		


### Conclusion
“Blockchain as a service (BaaS) is emerging as one of the most dynamic fields in technology, according to Amazon Web Services (AWS). BaaS solutions are designed to provide organizations across various business verticals with greater agility and lower costs by offering blockchain-based backends that cut out the middleman.”
