### Blockchain as a Service

### Introduction
The blockchain is the new buzzword in town and everyone seems to be talking about it. But how do businesses actually use the technology without having to build their own blockchains? Blockchain as a service (BaaS) enables companies to develop applications on various blockchains— such as Ethereum, Ripple or NEO —without having to code from scratch. Clients benefit from BaaS because it allows for faster application development, lower maintenance costs, and faster adoption of Blockchain technology.
### Topic to handle
- Defining Baas.
- Why choose Baas.
- What to check for while choosing Baas.
- Providers of Baas.

### Prerequisites
To understand this article one should have:
1. Good knowledge and understanding of how blockchain works.
   
### Definition of BaaS.
Baas involves customers using cloud services to create, host, develop and run their blockchain applications, and smart contracts in the software and any other relevant operations that can run blockchain technology. The cloud services are offered and managed by the cloud services provider. They are also responsible for any other related task to keep the systems up and running.

This is an introduction to BaaS, an important turning point in the blockchain ecosystem, with the potential to drive the widespread use of distributed ledger technologies industries. These are founded on and operates on principles that are alike to those used in SaaS. 

###Why choose BaaS?
Blockchain technology is increasingly being investigated by IT organizations across a wide range of industries for its strategic benefits. There are some technical difficulties, absence of domain expertise, and operational expenses associated with establishing, managing, and maintaining the Blockchain, as well as maintaining the infrastructure, typically lead key decision-makers to take their time with adoption plans.

1. Businesses that use Blockchain as a Service acquire access to qualified Blockchain developers, procedure and management specialists, the whole infrastructure from the cloud service provider for developing, programming, and deploying, not worrying about budget costs for any other operation that would cost them more.

2. In most situations, a reputable BaaS partner is a source of practical expertise and knowledge that can improve the security of the systems. It considerably reduces the dangerous cases that might otherwise be encountered if they were created in-house.

### Understanding BaaS
BaaS allows users to create, host, and administer their blockchain apps and related blockchain processes using cloud-based technology. The infrastructure is kept adaptive and operating by the cloud-based service provider.
BaaS is considered as an exploit of blockchain in the blockchain ecosystem that will help enterprises adopt blockchain technology.
### How it Works
![How it Works](/engineering-education/understanding-blockchain-as-a-service/howitworks.jpg)

- When a company (customer) signs a BaaS contract with an IT partner, means effectively agreeing that the BaaS partner would build all that's required in terms of Blockchain system or software for the clients in exchange for the cost of the service fee that's stated in agreement.

- On behalf of customers, the BaaS providing the service deploys all requirements of the system and also leveraging the necessary technologies and equipment to create as well as managing Blockchain-connected nodes.

- BaaS providers may use any distributed ledger available like bitcoin or Ethereum, based on customer's business requirements to set up a blockchain network.

- Furthermore, the Blockchain as a Service provider is responsible for maintaining all-important Blockchain-related artifacts as well as managing the infrastructure. Support tasks like managing bandwidth, optimizing resources, managing incidents, monitoring health systems, and proactive security surveillance like preventing hacking attempts are also included in BaaS contracts.

- Clients using the BaaS model can put considerations to main operations and other strategies. Meanwhile, the BaaS partner is in charge of the Blockchain system as well as the performance. This enables running distributed-ledger workloads using systems that have a high level of any failing of tolerance.

###Consider these factors while considering blockchain as a service provider.
Choosing a business vendor necessitates a great deal of thought and analysis, and in the case of BaaS, this will be even more challenging due to the lack of readily available standards and best practices in the market. While there are numerous things to consider when selecting a BaaS provider, there are a few general rules to follow.
![Considerations](/engineering-education/understanding-blockchain-as-a-service/consideration.jpg)

1. Prior experience/credentials in establishing blockchain infrastructure.
Make sure your BaaS provider has a track record of creating and Blockchain technology deployment and in a similar environment to the one you propose. If at all possible, inquire about qualifications or references from former clients.

2. Commitment to Quality.
Any enterprise application or software installation effort must prioritize quality. Blockchain is no exception. Inquire about the dedication to quality, process, and standards of the vendor.

3. Assurance of safety.
Examine the proposed implementation technique for any security issues. It's critical because even minor flaws can have serious consequences. When it comes to distributed ledgers, it is critical to plan for the most dependable results.
4. Operation System Selection.
Examine the previous installations of cloud-based services and the system they operate on that are similar to yours by the vendor. You must also guarantee that the new Blockchain installation works in tandem with your existing system.
 5. Usability.
Ensure Blockchain-enabled systems and processes you're proposing are simple to use and implement. After all, you don't want a system that's difficult to use or navigate for your staff, since this could lower adoption rates and hurt your bottom line.
 6. Prices and Supporters.
Every customer desires to pay the Cost of that which a BaaS provider provides. Examine alternatives of pricing as well as the deploying support and modalities carefully. Paying for that adds the biggest value to your company.

###  Baas providers include:
1. In 2015, Microsoft, in collaboration with ConsenSys, launched Ethereum blockchain-as-a-service on Azure (Microsoft).
2. Amazon, which announced Amazon Managed Blockchain, which "makes it easier to construct and administer large blockchain networks" by leveraging open-source frameworks such as Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric.
3. Corda, a distributed financial ledger, was developed by R3, a collection of international financial institutions.
4. Pay Stand is a corporation that specializes in sending and receiving payments between businesses.
   
    
### Limitation of BaaS
Consumers and organizations alike are becoming more open to using blockchain concepts. The presence of technical intricacies, the overhead operational association present to some building, configurations, operating, as well as maintaining a blockchain system, required infrastructure, on the other hand, frequently function as a barrier.

For a price, BaaS hires an outside Baas company that provides the services to set up all of the required blockchain components as well as requirements. After these have been established, the client's sophisticated back-end processes are handled by the provider.

Support services, such as bandwidth control, resource allocation, hosting requirements, and data security features, are often provided by the BaaS operator. Then allows the customer to what matters most: is blockchain's functioning.

### BaaS Example is shown below
![Baas Example](/engineering-education/understanding-blockchain-as-a-service/baas.jpg)

The job of a BaaS supplier is like that of a web hosting company. All web content is created and run on the website developers' personal computers. They might engage support workers or web hosting service providers like Amazon Web Services or HostGator.Infrastructure, as well as maintenance issues, are handled by these third-party companies.

BaaS might be the impetus for the larger use of blockchain technology in a variety of industries and businesses. A firm, may simply technologically outsource complicated labor focusing on the main goals rather than establishing and administering their blockchains.

### Conclusions
BaaS acts as a back-end solution for a blockchain-based program or platform, similar to a web host. BaaS could be a spark for widespread adoption of the technology. Keep exploring more on Blockchain.

Happy learning!
