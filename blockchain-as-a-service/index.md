### Introduction
The blockchain is the new buzzword in town and everyone seems to be talking about it. But how do businesses actually use the technology without having to build their own blockchains? Blockchain as a service (BaaS) enables companies to develop applications on various blockchains— such as Ethereum, Ripple or NEO —without having to code from scratch. Clients benefit from BaaS because it allows for faster application development, lower maintenance costs, and faster adoption of Blockchain technology.

### Prerequisites
To understand this article one should have:
- Good knowledge and understanding of how blockchain works.
### Definition of Blockchain as a service
Cloud applications provide a variety of on-demand services such as compute, storage, security and preconfigured APIs. In the same way blockchain as a service (BaaS) provides access to back end infrastructure for companies that want to use blockchain technology but don't have the skills or resources on hand to build their own software.

Blockchain as a service (BaaS) offers an alternative way to implement blockchain technology. It allows companies to focus on their business problems without having to worry about the underlying distributed ledger system.

The actual definition of blockchain as a service is broader than one specific option for application development. Different types of BaaS provide different sets of functionalities and we can group them depending on these functionalities.

### How is the adoption of blockchain aided by BaaS?
BaaS provides a platform that accelerates development lifecycles through rapid deployment, minimal upfront costs, and quick time to market. It also reduces the cost of integration, testing, security, migration and operations so that business users can focus more on building applications for their business needs.

### Why choose BaaS? 

- What is the benefit of rapid deployment?
Applications can be up and running in a fraction of the time it would take in a traditional development environment, which means that companies can actually start making money faster from their own Blockchain Apps. 

BaaS allows for BApps with nearly zero capital investment in software engineering. The cost of Blockchain Apps development is almost negligible, thanks to the availability of pre-packaged Blockchain APIs.
- How are the costs reduced?
There are no upfront capital expenditures for equipment because BaaS services run on existing cloud infrastructure, so there’s no need to buy expensive hardware or hire specialized labor. There are also no resources wasted on devising separate strategies to implement security, scaling, or data management.
- What are the benefits of quick time to market?
Typically there is a lot of back and forth between development and IT to make sure that apps will work in company’s existing infrastructure. BaaS removes this step by providing rapid prototyping and deployment of Blockchain Apps. 

With BaaS there’s no need to invest in customizing your own blockchain infrastructure which allows companies to get up and running faster while reducing maintenance costs, improving system reliability, and providing better scalability.
- What are the benefits of minimal upfront costs?
BaaS reduces the costs of building new applications, integrating with pre-existing systems, migrating existing data, testing Blockchain Apps, and running them in production. Companies need not spend time or money on the setup cost which might include setting up your own sandbox environment with nodes to start developing BApp.

### Understanding BaaS
BaaS allows users to create, host, and administer their blockchain apps and related blockchain processes using cloud-based technology. The infrastructure is kept adaptive and operating by the cloud-based service provider. BaaS is considered as an exploit of blockchain in the blockchain ecosystem that will help enterprises adopt blockchain technology.

### How it Works

When a company (customer) signs a BaaS contract with an IT partner, means effectively agreeing that the BaaS partner would build all that's required in terms of Blockchain system or software for the clients in exchange for the cost of the service fee that's stated in agreement.

On behalf of customers, the BaaS providing the service deploys all requirements of the system and also leveraging the necessary technologies and equipment to create as well as managing Blockchain-connected nodes.

BaaS providers may use any distributed ledger available like bitcoin or Ethereum, based on customer's business requirements to set up a blockchain network.

Furthermore, the Blockchain as a Service provider is responsible for maintaining all-important Blockchain-related artifacts as well as managing the infrastructure. Support tasks like managing bandwidth, optimizing resources, managing incidents, monitoring health systems, and proactive security surveillance like preventing hacking attempts are also included in BaaS contracts.

Clients using the BaaS model can put considerations to main operations and other strategies. Meanwhile, the BaaS partner is in charge of the Blockchain system as well as the performance. This enables running distributed-ledger workloads using systems that have a high level of any failing of tolerance.

### Consider these factors while considering blockchain as a service provider.
Choosing a business vendor necessitates a great deal of thought and analysis, and in the case of BaaS, this will be even more challenging due to the lack of readily available standards and best practices in the market. While there are numerous things to consider when selecting a BaaS provider, there are a few general rules to follow. Considerations : 

- Prior experience/credentials in establishing blockchain infrastructure. Make sure your BaaS provider has a track record of creating and Blockchain technology deployment and in a similar environment to the one you propose. If at all possible, inquire about qualifications or references from former clients.

- Commitment to Quality. Any enterprise application or software installation effort must prioritize quality. Blockchain is no exception. Inquire about the dedication to quality, process, and standards of the vendor.

- Assurance of safety. Examine the proposed implementation technique for any security issues. It's critical because even minor flaws can have serious consequences. When it comes to distributed ledgers, it is critical to plan for the most dependable results.

- Operation System Selection. Examine the previous installations of cloud-based services and the system they operate on that are similar to yours by the vendor. You must also guarantee that the new Blockchain installation works in tandem with your existing system.

- Usability. Ensure Blockchain-enabled systems and processes you're proposing are simple to use and implement. After all, you don't want a system that's difficult to use or navigate for your staff, since this could lower adoption rates and hurt your bottom line.

- Prices and Supporters. Every customer desires to pay the Cost of that which a BaaS provider provides. Examine alternatives of pricing as well as the deploying support and modalities carefully. Paying for that adds the biggest value to your company.
### Can we control bandwidth or resource allocation or hosting even for public blockchain?
Most of the open source blockchain implementations are controlled by one or few individual entity. That will not scale well for globe spanning decentralized apps.We need an abstraction layer where one can easily provision and de-provision any number of public instances (over TCP/IP) hosting a blockchain; we call this Blockchain as a service (BaaS) .
### Baas providers include:
- In 2015, Microsoft, in collaboration with ConsenSys, launched Ethereum blockchain-as-a-service on Azure (Microsoft).
Amazon, which announced Amazon Managed Blockchain, which "makes it easier to construct and administer large blockchain networks" by leveraging open-source frameworks such as Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric.
- Corda, a distributed financial ledger, was developed by R3, a collection of international financial institutions.
Pay Stand is a corporation that specializes in sending and receiving payments between businesses.

### Baas Example

An Example of a company using blockchain as a service is Microsoft's Azure. On the Azure website, developers can find a platform to develop and test blockchain applications (Azure). It is believed that this will allow financial institutions and banks to work more closely with each other on what are called smart contracts. Without going into too much detail, they are basically data based scripts that self execute when specific conditions are met.

There is also a blog post written by the CTO of Microsoft's Azure, Mark Russinovich and even an entire site dedicated to blockchain as a service development, BlockApps. BlockApps website provides developers with guidelines and tutorials on how they can build their own private blockchain implementation (Blockapps). Using its tools and modules, developers can build, test and deploy their own blockchain applications that use smart contracts.

### Conclusions
BaaS acts as a back-end solution for a blockchain-based program or platform, similar to a web host. BaaS could be a spark for widespread adoption of the technology. Keep exploring more on Blockchain.
