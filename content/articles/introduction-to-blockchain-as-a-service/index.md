The blockchain is the new buzzword in town and everyone seems to be talking about it. But, how do businesses actually use the technology without having to build it from scratch?
<!--more-->
Blockchain as a service (BaaS) enables companies to develop applications on various blockchains - such as Ethereum, Ripple or NEO - without having to code from scratch.

Clients benefit from BaaS since it allows faster application development, lower maintenance costs, and faster adoption of blockchain technology.

- Providers of Baas.
  
### Prerequisites
To understand this article, one should have good knowledge and understanding of how blockchain works.

### Blockchain as a Service
Cloud applications provide a variety of on-demand services such as compute engine, storage, security and pre-configured APIs.

In the same way, Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) provides access to back-end infrastructure for companies that wants to use blockchain technology, but don't have the skills or resources to build their own software.

Blockchain as a service (BaaS) offers an alternative way to implement blockchain technology. It allows companies to focus on their business problems without having to worry about the underlying [distributed ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger) system.

The actual definition of BaaS is much broader than one specific option for application development. Different types of BaaS provide different sets of functionalities that can grouped based on functionalities.

### How is the adoption of blockchain aided by BaaS?
BaaS provides a platform that accelerates the development lifecycles through rapid deployment, minimal upfront costs, and quick time to market.

It also reduces the cost of integration, testing, security, migration, and operations, so that business users can focus more on building applications for their business needs.

### Why choose BaaS? 
#### What is the benefit of rapid deployment?
Applications can be up and running much faster when compared to traditional development environments. Meaning - the companies can actually start making money faster by deploying Blockchain apps faster.

BaaS allows development blockchain apps (BApps) with nearly zero capital investment into software engineering. The cost is almost negligible.

Thanks to the availability of pre-packaged Blockchain APIs.

#### How are the costs reduced?
There are no upfront capital expenditures exclusively for the blockchain infrastructure, since BaaS services runs on existing cloud infrastructure. So, there's no need to purchase expensive hardware or hire specialized labor.

There are almost no resources to be wasted on devising separate strategies for implementing security, scaling, or managing data.

#### What are the benefits of quick time for the go-to-market (GTM)?
Typically, there would be a lot of back and forth between development and IT to make sure that apps works with company's existing infrastructure.

We need worry about these, since BaaS provides rapid prototyping and deployment of Blockchain Apps.

BaaS also helps in reducing maintenance costs, improving system reliability, and providing better scalability.

#### What are the benefits of minimal upfront costs?
BaaS reduces the costs of building new applications, integrating with pre-existing systems, migrating existing data, testing, and running them in production.

Companies need not spend time or money to setup their own sandbox environment with nodes to start developing BApp.

### Understanding BaaS
BaaS allows users to create, host, and administer their blockchain apps and  processes using cloud-based technology. The infrastructure is kept adaptive and operating by the cloud-based service provider.

BaaS is considered as an exploit of blockchain in the blockchain ecosystem that helps enterprises adopt this technology.

### How it works?
When a company (customer) signs a BaaS contract with an IT partner, the company effectively agrees that the BaaS partner would build all that's required in terms of Blockchain system or software for the clients in exchange for the cost of the service fee that's stated in agreement.

On behalf of customers, the BaaS providing the service deploys all requirements of the system and also leverages the necessary technologies and equipment to create as well as manage Blockchain-connected nodes.

BaaS providers may use any distributed ledger available like Bitcoin or Ethereum, based on customer's business requirements to set up a blockchain network.

Furthermore, the BaaS provider is responsible for maintaining all the important Blockchain-related artifacts as well as managing the infrastructure.

Support tasks like managing bandwidth, optimizing resources, managing incidents, monitoring health systems, and proactive security surveillance like preventing hacking attempts are also included in BaaS contracts.

Clients using the BaaS model can put considerations to main operations and other strategies.

Meanwhile, the BaaS partner is in charge of the blockchain system as well as the performance. This enables running distributed ledger workloads using systems that have a high level of any failing of tolerance.

### Factors to consider while choosing a BaaS provider
Choosing a business vendor necessitates a great deal of thought and analysis.

In the case of BaaS, this will be even more challenging due to the lack of readily available standards and best practices in the market.

While there are numerous things to consider when selecting a BaaS provider, there are a few general rules to follow: 

#### Prior experience/credentials in establishing blockchain infrastructure
Make sure your BaaS provider has a track record of creating blockchain technology based deployment or in a similar environment to the one that you propose.

If at all possible, inquire about qualifications or references from former clients.

#### Commitment to quality
Any enterprise application or software installation effort must prioritize quality. Blockchain is no exception. Inquire about the dedication to quality, process, and standards of the vendor.

#### Assurance of safety
Examine the proposed implementation technique for any security issues.

It's critical because even minor flaws can lead to serious consequences. When it comes to distributed ledgers, it is critical to plan for the most dependable results.

#### Operation System selection
Examine the previous installations of cloud-based services and the system they operate on. You must also guarantee that the new Blockchain installation works in tandem with your existing system.

#### Usability
Ensure blockchain enabled systems and processes you're proposing are simple to use and implement.

After all, you don't want a system that's difficult to use or navigate for your staff, since this could lower the adoption rates and hurt your bottom line.

#### Prices and Supporters
Every customer desires to pay the cost of that which a BaaS provider provides.

Examine alternatives of pricing, as well as the deploying support and modalities. Paying for that, adds the biggest value to your company.

### Can we control bandwidth or resource allocation or hosting even for public blockchain?
Most of the open source blockchain implementations are controlled by one or few individual entity. That will not scale well for globe spanning decentralized apps.

We need an abstraction layer where one can easily provision and de-provision any number of public instances (over TCP/IP) hosting a blockchain; we call this Blockchain as a service (BaaS).

### Baas provider
- In 2015, Microsoft, in collaboration with ConsenSys, launched Ethereum [blockchain-as-a-service on Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/solutions/blockchain/) (Microsoft).
Amazon, which announced Amazon Managed Blockchain, which "makes it easier to construct and administer large blockchain networks" by leveraging open-source frameworks such as Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric.
- [Corda](https://www.corda.net), a distributed financial ledger developed by R3 is a collection of international financial institutions.
- [Pay Stand](https://www.paystand.com/solutions/enterprise-blockchain) is a corporation that specializes in sending and receiving payments between businesses.

### Baas example
An example of a company using BaaS is Microsoft's Azure.

On the Azure website, developers can find a platform to develop and test blockchain applications (Azure).

It is believed that this will allow financial institutions and banks to work more closely with each other on what are called [smart contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp).

Without going too much into the details, smart contracts are basically data based scripts that self-execute when specific conditions are met.

There is also a [blog post](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/blog/author/markruss/) written by the CTO of Microsoft's Azure, Mark Russinovich and even an entire site dedicated to BaaS development called [BlockApps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/blog/blockapps-strato-smd-upgrade/).

BlockApps website provides developers with guidelines and tutorials on how they can build their own private blockchain implementation (Blockapps). Using its tools and modules, developers can build, test and deploy their own blockchain applications that use smart contracts.

### Conclusion
BaaS acts as a back-end solution for a blockchain-based program or platform, similar to a web host. BaaS could be a spark for widespread adoption of the technology.

Keep exploring more on Blockchain.
