### Blockchain as a Service

### Introduction
Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) is the establishment and management of cloud-based networks by a third party for companies that develop blockchain applications. BaaS is based on the software as a service (SaaS) model and allows clients to use cloud services to build, host services, work on apps, and other blockchain-related functions. Clients benefit from BaaS because it allows for faster application development, lower maintenance costs, and faster adoption of Blockchain technology.

### Prerequisites
To understand this article one should have:
	1. Good knowledge and understanding of how blockchain works.
	2. Good understanding of basics of Blockchain.
	3. Basic information about applications of Blockchain.
   
### Definition of BaaS?
Baas involves customers using cloud services to create,host,develop and run their  blockchain applications,any smart contracts in the softwares and any other relevant operations that can run  blockchain  technology.The  cloud services are offered and managed by the cloud services provider.They are also responsible of any other related task to keep the systems up and running.

This is  an introduction to BaaS,an important turning point in the blockchain ecosystem, with a potential to drive the widespread use of distributed ledger technologies industries. These is founded on and operates on principles that are alike to those used in SaaS.SaaS stands for Software as a Service.

### Reasons Companies choose BaaS?
Blockchain technology is increasingly being investigated by IT organizations across a wide range of industries for its strategic benefits. There are some technological difficulties, absence of domain expertise, and operational expenses associated with establishing, managing, and maintaining the Blockchain, as well as maintaining the infrastructure, typically lead key decision makers to take their time with adoption plans.

   1. Businesses that use Blockchain as a Service acquire access to qualified Blockchain developers, procedure and management specialists, the whole  infrastructure from cloud service provider for developing, programming and deploying, not worrying about budget costs for any other operation that would cost them more.

   2. In most situations, a reputable BaaS partner is a source of practical expertise and knowldege that can improve security of the systems. It considerably reduces the dangers cases that might otherwise be encountered if it were created in-house.

### Understand BaaS
BaaS is based on the software as a service architecture and performs similarly. It allows users to create, host, and administer their own blockchain apps and related blockchain processes using cloud-based technology. The infrastructure is kept adaptive and operating by the cloud-based service provider.
BaaS is considered as an exploit of blockchain in the blockchain ecosystem that will help enterprises adopt blockchain technology.
### How it Works
![How it Works](/engineering-education/understanding-blockchain-as-a-service/howitworks.jpg)

- When a company (customer) signs a BaaS contract with an IT partner, means effectively agreeing that the BaaS partner would build all thats required interms of Blockchain system or software  for the clients in exchange for cost of service fee thats stated in agreement.

- On behalf of customers, the BaaS providing the service deploys all necessary requirements of system and also leaveraging the necessary technologies and equipements to create as well as managing Blockchain connected nodes.

- BaaS provider may use any  distributed ledger available like bitcoin or ethereum, based on  customer's business requirements to set up blockchain network.

- Furthermore, the Blockchain as a Service provider is responsible for maintaining all important Blockchain-related artifacts as well as managing the infrastructure. Support tasks like managing bandwidth , optimizing resources, managing incidents, monitoring health system, and proactive security surveillance like preventing hacking attempt are also included in BaaS contracts.

- Clients using BaaS model can put considerations to main operations and other strategies.Meanwhile the BaaS partner is in charge of the Blockchain sytem as well as the performance.These enables running distributed-ledger workloads using systems that have high level of any failing of tolerance .

###  Considerations When Choosing a Blockchain as a Service Provider ?##
Choosing a business vendor necessitates a great deal of thought and analysis, and in the case of BaaS, this will be even more challenging due to the lack of readily available standards and best practices in the market. While there are numerous things to consider when selecting a BaaS provider, there are a few general rules to follow.
![Consideration](/engineering-education/understanding-blockchain-as-a-service/consideration.jpg)

1. Prior experience/credentials in establishing blockchain infrastructure.
Make sure your BaaS provider has a track record of creating and Blockchain technology deployment and in a similar environment to the one you propose. If at all possible, inquire about qualifications or references from former clients.

2. Commitment to Quality.
Any enterprise application or software installation effort must prioritize quality. Blockchain is no exception. Inquire about the dedication to quality, process, and standards of the vendor.

3. Affirmation of safety.
Look for any security flaws in the proposed implementation strategy. It's critical because even minor flaws can have serious consequences. When it comes to distributed ledgers, it is critical to plan for the most dependable results.
4. Operation System Selection.
Examine the  previous  installations of cloud-based services and system they operate on that are similar to yours by the vendor. You must also guarantee that the new Blockchain installation works in tandem with your existing system.
 5. Usability.
Ensure Blockchain-enabled systems and processes you're proposing are simple to use and implement. After all, you don't want a system that's difficult to use or navigate for your staff, since this could lower adoption rates and hurt your bottom line.
 6. Prices and Supporters.
Every customer desires to pay Cost of that which a BaaS provider provides. Examine alternatives of pricing as well as the deploying support and modalities carefully. Paying for that which adds biggest value to your company.

###  Baas providers include:
1. In 2015, Microsoft, in collaboration with ConsenSys, launched Ethereum blockchain-as-a-service on Azure (Microsoft).
2. Amazon, which announced Amazon Managed Blockchain, which "makes it easier to construct and administer large blockchain networks" by leveraging open source frameworks such as Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric.
3. Corda, a distributed financial ledger, was developed by R3, a collection of international financial institutions.
4. Pay Stand is a corporation that specializes in sending and receiving payments between businesses.
   
    
### Limitation of BaaS
Consumers and organizations alike are becoming more open to using blockchain concepts.Presence of technical  intricacies,overhead operational  association present to some building, configurations, operating, as well as maintaining a blockchain system,required infrastructure, on the other hand, frequently function as a barrier.

For a price, BaaS hires an outside Baas company that provides the services to set up all of required blockchain components as well as requirements. After these has been established, the client's sophisticated back-end processes are handled by the provider.

Support services, such as bandwidth control, resource allocation, hosting requirements, and data security features, are often provided by the BaaS operator. Then allows the customer to what matters most: is blockchain's functioning.

### BaaS Example is shown below

In fact, the job of a BaaS supplier is like that of a web hosting company. All of web content is created and run on the website developers' personal computers. They might engage support workers or web hosting service provider like Amazon Web Services or HostGator.Infrastructure as well as maintenance issues are handled by these third-party companies.

BaaS might be the impetus for a larger use for blockchain technology in a variety of industries and businesses. A firm, may simply technologically outsource complicated labor focusing on the main goals rather than establishing and administering their own blockchains.

### Conclusions
BaaS acts is back-end solution for blockchain-based program or platform, similar to a web host. BaaS could be a spark for widespread adoption of the technology. Keep exploring more on Blockchain.

Happy learning!
